# **greetings:** Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to the _greetings_ project! This repository aims to provide a collection of greetings for various occasions. Whether it's a birthday, anniversary, or any special event, you'll find the perfect greeting here.


## General Guidelines

### Be Respectful
Treat all participants with kindness and respect. Disagreements and differences of opinion are natural, but they should be handled constructively and without personal attacks or derogatory language.

### Inclusive Language
Use language that is inclusive, respectful, and considerate of all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds or identities.

### Harassment-Free Environment
Harassment in any form is not tolerated within the _greetings_ community. Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive comments, discrimination, intimidation, or any unwelcome behavior that creates an uncomfortable environment for others.

### Avoid Spamming
Please refrain from submitting meaningless or excessive pull requests. Ensure that your contributions are meaningful and aligned with the project's goals.

### Reporting Violations
If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be kept confidential, and appropriate actions will be taken in response.

## Coding Guidelines
When contributing to _greetings,_ please follow these coding guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase:

### 1. Code Style
- Follow the established coding style used in the project. If there are no specific guidelines, adhere to a common style like [PEP 8 for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

### 2. Code Comments
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of your code.
- Provide comments for any public functions, classes, or methods, describing their purpose and usage.

### 3. Variable and Function Names
- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- Avoid using single-letter variable names except in simple loop constructs.

### 4. Indentation and Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces) to improve code readability.
- Keep lines of code within a reasonable length (typically 80-100 characters) to avoid horizontal scrolling.

### 5. Imports
- Group imports according to the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local project imports
- Use absolute imports over relative imports.

### 6. Error Handling
- Always handle exceptions and errors gracefully. Avoid using bare `except` clauses.
- Provide informative error messages to aid in debugging.

### 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for your code, **especially if it introduces new functionality or fixes a bug.**
- Ensure that all existing tests pass before submitting your code.

### 8. Version Control
- Keep your commits focused and atomic, addressing a single issue or feature in each commit.
- Use meaningful commit messages that start with a capital letter and provide a concise description of the changes.

### 9. Documentation
- Document all public functions, classes, and methods using clear and concise docstrings.
- Maintain up-to-date project documentation to assist users and fellow contributors.

### 10. Performance Considerations
- Optimize code for performance when necessary, but prioritize readability and maintainability.

### 11. Peer Review
- Be open to peer review and constructive feedback. Reviewers may offer valuable insights to improve your code.

### 12. Keep It Simple
- Strive for simplicity in your code. Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering.
These coding guidelines are meant to help create a consistent and maintainable codebase within the greetings project. Adhering to these guidelines will make it easier for contributors to collaborate effectively and ensure the project remains accessible to everyone involved.

## Our Commitment
The project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct and ensuring that all reports are handled promptly and fairly. We are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful community for everyone involved.
